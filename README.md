# Hello GitHub Actions

![Python package](https://github.com/jbencook/hello-actions/workflows/Python%20package/badge.svg?branch=master)

This is a test of GitHub Actions

## Self-hosting

* [Adding self-hosted runners](https://help.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners)
* Trouble getting macOS runner to download Python versions with `actions/setup-python`
* [Docker actions-runner](https://hub.docker.com/r/zerosuxx/github-actions-runner)
* `actions/setup-python` doesn't currently work on [self-hosted nodes](https://github.com/actions/setup-python/issues/89#issuecomment-624924329)
* Can [build with Docker](https://github.com/jbencook/hello-actions/runs/655031200?check_suite_focus=true)
* Failing [works correctly](https://github.com/jbencook/hello-actions/runs/655033213?check_suite_focus=true)

## Security

* **We recommend that you do not use self-hosted runners with public repositories.**
